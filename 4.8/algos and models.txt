traditional machine learning approaches

- decision trees: flowchart like structures aiding in decision making based on data features. eg. is it sunny? is it rainy?

- regression algorithms: useful for predicting nurmerical values by modeling relationships between variables.

- clustering algorithms: group data into clusters based on similarity, aiding in data segmentation and categorization. what car models might use to group data such as pedestrians, cars, etc.


deep learning

artificial neural networks - heavily inspired by human brain, made of neural networks, they excel in processing huge amoutns of data and learning patterns from it.

convolutional neural networks (CNN) - specialized for vision tasks, preserving spatial context of iamages.

recurrent neural networks (RNN) - efficient for sequential data, aiding in tasks like predictive text. (eg. chatbots, predicting next works on your iphone as you're typing)


generative deep learning: great for creating new content based on learned patterns from data.


transformer architecture (encoder-decoder model): consists of layers of encoders and decoders. great for language translation and code generation tasks. (LLMs!!!)


tldr; 
traditional - good for structure data. less computing resources.
deep learning - good with large amounts of unstructured data and capturing intricate patterns.
